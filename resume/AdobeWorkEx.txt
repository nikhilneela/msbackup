I have been working in Adobe from the past 2+ years.
At Adobe, I am working on developing Android apps.
Have been working on a professional painting and drawing app called Illustrator Draw.
It's an Award winning and highly rated (4.2) app on the playstore competing with other paid apps.
Coming to my contributions to this app,

1. I have been working on this app right from it's inception
2. I divide my contributions into the following
   1. UI/UX design implementation
   		1. Launch screens
   		2. Organizer (Commom UI)
   		3. Document Editor screens (Toolbars, Layers Editor)
   		4. Color picker
   		5. Workflows like signing in, share to other apps and so on
   	2.  Graphics related work
   		The core part of our app has been written in C++ for consistency and reuseability purposes
   		For example, Our app interacts with the underlying C++ library for generating strokes and rendering
   		them to the screen. A whole lot of work is done in native and wrappers for them are written
   		in Java (using JNI). I primarily worked in mainpulating
   			1. Layers
   			2. Tools like brushes
   			3. Grids and Guides
   	3.  Sync workflows
   	    Our app is a highly cloud centric app meaning all user assets are stored in Cloud (Creative Cloud)
   	    There was a good amount of work done in developing workflows around syncing the assets between the
   	    client device and cloud
   	4. Regular engineering tasks
   	   1. Some knowledge on Jenkins and CI, SonarQube and Test automation
